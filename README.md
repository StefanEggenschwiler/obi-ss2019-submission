# Comparison of Nature-Inspired and Graph Algorithms Solving Travelling Salesman Problems
Optimization for Business Improvement (SS 2019)

This is the repository of the prototype artefacts developed to conduct the analysis and its generated data. This research was conducted as part of the module "Optimization for Business Improvement" for the Business Information Systems master degree program at the [University of Applied Science Northwestern Switzerland](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/degree-programmes/business/msc-bis).

## Getting Started

The artefacts were developed using the latest version of MATLAB and several add-ons listed under the next section.

## Built With

* [MATLAB R2019 Update 1](https://ch.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) - MATLAB is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment and proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks.

  * [Parallel Computing Toolbox](https://ch.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) - Perform parallel computations on multicore computers, GPUs, and clusters.

  * [Simulink](https://ch.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html) - Model-Based Design: From Concept to Code.

  * [Optimization Toolbox](https://ch.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html) - Solve linear, quadratic, integer, and nonlinear optimization problems.

  * [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://ch.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html) - Analyze and model data using statistics and machine learning.

  * [xml2struct ext.](https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/58700-xml2struct-with-bug-fix-and-added-features) - An improved version of xml2struct that converts xml documents into MATLAB structures.
