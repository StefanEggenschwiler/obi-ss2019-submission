	abstract = "This paper proposes a new optimization technique called the African Buffalo Optimization. The African Buffalo Optimization (ABO) draws its inspiration from the behavior of African buffalos in the vast African forests and savannahs. African buffalos are a wild species of domestic cattle and are always mobile tracking the rainy seasons in different parts of Africa in search of lush green pastures to satisfy their large appetites. Our interest is in their organizational ability through two basic sounds in search of solutions. Experiments carried out using this novel algorithm in solving some benchmark Travelling Salesman's Problem when compared with the results from some popular optimization algorithms show that the ABO was not only able to obtain better solutions but at a faster speed."

abstract = "Bumble Bees Mating Optimization (BBMO) algorithm is a relatively new swarm intelligence algorithm that simulates the mating behaviour that a swarm of bumble bees performs. In this paper, an improved version of the BBMO algorithm is presented for successfully solving the Open Vehicle Routing Problem. The main contribution of the paper is that the equation which describes the movement of the drones outside the hive has been replaced by a local search procedure. Thus, the algorithm became more suitable for combinatorial optimization problems. The Open Vehicle Routing Problem (OVRP) is a variant of the classic vehicle routing problem. In the OVRP the vehicles do not return to the depot after the service of the customers. Two sets of benchmark instances were used in order to test the proposed algorithm. The obtained results were very satisfactory as in most instances the proposed algorithm found the best known solutions. More specifically, in the fourteen instances proposed by Christofides, the average quality was 0.09% when a hierarchical objective function was used, where, first, the number of vehicles is minimized and, afterwards, the total travel distance is minimized and the average quality was 0.11% when only the travel distance was minimized while for the eight instances proposed by Li et al. when a hierarchical objective function was used the average quality was 0.06%. The algorithm was, also, compared with a number of metaheuristic, evolutionary and nature inspired algorithms from the literature."

abstract="A new hybrid algorithm for clustering, which is based on the concepts of the Bumble Bees Mating Optimization (BBMO) and Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm is a two phase algorithm which combines a new algorithm called Bumble Bees Mating Optimization algorithm for the solution of the feature selection problem and a GRASP algorithm for the solution of the clustering problem. The performance of the algorithm is compared with other popular metaheuristic and nature inspired methods using datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The high performance of the proposed algorithm is achieved as the algorithm gives very good results and in some instances the percentage of the correct clustered samples is very high and is larger than 98{\%}.",
